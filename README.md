## Recommendations

- PyBer should look into considering reducing or setting a cap on fares in rural cities, which might lead to a market demand for ride-sharing drivers and riders.

- In terms of PyBer becoming the leading Ride-Sharing company, targeting Urban cities would generate higher profits by introducing more drivers, as there is already a large demand seen. 

- Reducing the number of drivers in Urban cities, will certainly create unemployment, but will average a better pay for each driver, leading to a sustainable living in Urban cities.
